# FlyingWhale-Airline-Case-

This project is to leverage the available Customer Flight Activity and Customer Loyalty 
History datasets to enhance FlyingWhale Airline's business intelligence capabilities. By analyzing 
customer flight activity, loyalty segmentation, and enrollment and cancellation trends, My aim is to 
develop strategic insights and actionable recommendations that will increase the duration of 
customer enrollments and reduce the rate of cancellations, ultimately improving customer retention 
and satisfaction.
